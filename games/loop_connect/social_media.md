Hey r/IndieGaming!

I wanted to share Loop Connect, a minimalist puzzle microgame that scratches that "just one more try" itch.

**The Concept:**
You get a 4x4 grid of pipe segments. Click to rotate. Complete all loops. You have 5 seconds.

Sounds simple? It starts zen-like at 1x speed. By 5x speed, it's pure pattern recognition adrenaline.

**What makes it different:**
- Black & white minimalist aesthetic (no visual clutter)
- Handcrafted puzzles (each solvable in 1-2 perfect moves)
- Progressive difficulty that actually scales with your skill
- Satisfying rotation animations and sound design
- Free to play in browser

Perfect for puzzle fans, speedrunners, or anyone who wants a quick brain workout during coffee breaks.

Built in Godot 4 as part of a WarioWare-style microgame collection. Each game is 5 seconds of pure focused gameplay.

What do you think? Would love feedback on the concept!
